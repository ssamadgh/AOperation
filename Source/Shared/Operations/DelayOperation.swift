This file shows how to make an operation that efficiently waits.

/**
    `DelayOperation` is a `ResultableOperation` that will simply wait for a given time
    interval, or until a specific `Date`.

    It is important to note that this operation does **not** use the `sleep()`
    function, since that is inefficient and blocks the thread on which it is called.
    Instead, this operation uses `dispatch_after` to know when the appropriate amount
    of time has passed.

    If the interval is negative, or the `NSDate` is in the past, then this operation
    immediately finishes.

	- Note: Set the Output as Void to use this operation independently. If you set Output other than Void type you should use this opeation as subscriberOperation. In this case the operation directly results the received value.
