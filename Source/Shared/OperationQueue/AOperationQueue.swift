 The delegate of an `AOperationQueue` can respond to `AOperation` lifecycle
 events by implementing these methods.

 In general, implementing `AOperationQueueDelegate` is not necessary; you would
 want to use an `OperationObserver` instead. However, there are a couple of
 situations where using `AOperationQueueDelegate` can lead to simpler code.
 For example, `GroupOperation` is the delegate of its own internal
 `AOperationQueue` and uses it to manage dependencies.
